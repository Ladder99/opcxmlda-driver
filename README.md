# opcxmlda-driver

## Overview

Fully configurable OPC XML-DA driver built on top of [base-driver](https://github.com/Ladder99/base-driver) and [QuickOPC libraries](https://www.opclabs.com/products/picoopc/227-products/quickopc).  Includes Splunk metric data output over MQTT.

Perfect for pulling data from Simotion drives running on Simatic Step 7 before OPC-UA was added.
